                              (SOA) and microservices.

                          Despite technological advancements, 90 percent of
                          business IT applications are legacy and what are known
                          as “monolithic”. These range from mainframe apps where
                          UI, business logic and data storage reside on
                          machines, to client-server applications where layered
                          technologies that support UI, business functionality
                          and data are stored horizontally. Microservices
                          architecture, on the other hand, divides the
                          functionality into cohesive verticals by implementing
                          a specific domain.

                        Maintaining monolithic applications often proves
                        challenging because it’s difficult to test and release
                        millions of lines of code for tiny changes (in most
                        cases only a few lines). But migrating to microservices
                        is not as simple as it sounds. It requires a big change
                        management process that often includes new team
                        structures (to say nothing of altering the mindset of
                        the organization!). To support the approach, technology
                        stack must also be upgraded. In the microservices
                        scheme, an application is built with a modular approach,
                        making it scalable and easier to deploy. With the right
                        tools, governance and automation in place, updates come
                        much easier.

                        While Monolith has complexity in codebase, microservices
                        poses the complexity of interaction between many
                        services.

                        As you refactor one large monolith application into
                        multiple independent services with their own services
                        and data layer, you probably would end up having 25+
                        services, 50+ databases (Cache, Relational, NoSQL,
                        Graph, Bigtable, Bigdata). Having them to deploy in
                        Discrete Hardware (server by server), the deployment
                        complexity itself will multiply to 50X at least. So, you
                        essentially need to aggregate the hardware, say you
                        aggregate your Compute/Network/Storage so that it looks
                        like ONE big unit with combined capacity and you keep
                        deploying your services & databases inside that
                        aggregated cluster transparent of underlying
                        Compute/Network/Storage. Thankfully, current cloud-based
                        distributed technologies offer many avenues to aggregate
                        hardware across data centers and geographies.

                          As you transform monolith to microservices, your big X
                          becomes 100 small x. If you deploy that 100 x as a
                          layered stack in discrete servers in a different way,
                          your deployment complexity would multiply to 1000X. To
                          address this challenge, you definitely need to unify
                          the delivery of services, make sure your services are
                          delivered in the same way and they are staged to the
                          production environment through some stringent quality
                          gates. To unify the delivery of multiple services in
                          the same way, Containerization play a big role and
                          Containers along with the Continuous Delivery channel
                          brings down your 1000X complexity to a factor of X.

                          Simply speaking the microservice world is “Solve small
                          problems, with small teams with measurable outcomes vs
                          solving 1 big problem with 1 large team.”
                          <br />
                          Since its small teams being responsible for end to end
                          success, it’s much essential to establish a culture
                          that “You built it, you run it”. Dev & Ops married,
                          become DevOps. It means each employee are skilled to
                          Develop small services and able to maintain its
                          complete lifecycle. That involves a big change in
                          structure & skills of the organization. Most of the

                            Though it depends on complexity & sizing of the
                            existing applications, you could accelerate the
                            transformation process by engaging a microservices
                            SYNECTIKS who can help you as follows:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Accelerate the transformation by using open
                              application and automation blocks and frameworks
                              built by SYNECTIKS team, so that you can leverage
                              lot of existing code and reuse your maximum
                              existing codebase. A typical large transformation
                              project can take a year long effort and often
                              don’t yield results. We recommend taking bottom -
                              up approach, take a small piece of functionality,
                              and develop the services and foundation for it
                              rapidly by using existing application blocks and
                              automation framework. You would minimize your
                              risks by investing a small time & money and
                              continue to do so when you see a significant ROI.
                              The key aspect is time. The advantage of making us
                              your microservices partner is, our open source
