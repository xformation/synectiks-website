                        Public, Private, and Hybrid Clouds
                      </h5>
                      <p className="ptext mb-3">
                        Public cloud is what people think of when they hear the
                        word “cloud.” It’s ideal for application development,
                        scientific data processing, and web-scale applications.
                        On the downside, SLAs can be weak and security can be
                        limited. Exclusive use of the public cloud becomes less
                        economically feasible as usage scales.
                      </p>
                      <p className="ptext mb-3">
                        Once applications hit a certain usage/cost threshold, or
                        have strict requirements, such as security or data
                        protection, that cannot be met by the public cloud,
                        organizations often consider a private cloud. IT favors
                        the private cloud for core enterprise security;
                        applications run on infrastructure that is solely
                        assigned to your company and that facilitates auditing
                        and compliance. The reality is that most organizations
                        will need a blend of these options for different
                        purposes.

                        This is referred to as a hybrid cloud. It allows
                        organizations to use the public cloud where it makes
                        sense, to create private clouds to support certain
                        application types, and to use advanced techniques such
                        as cloud hubbing situating critical hardware in network
                        data centers in close proximity to telecom providers,
                        content distribution networks, and application component
                        providers to place their applications optimally to
                        ensure rapid response time. Hybrid cloud automates and
                        modernizes the applications estate, places workloads in
                        their optimal location, embeds security, enables an IT
                        brokerage model and creates a simple, agile, on-demand
                        environment. Hybrid Cloud also lays the foundation for
                        embracing new technologies such as containerization,
                        serverless, platform as a service (PaaS), IoT and edge
                        computing all with an eye toward improving business
                        outcomes.

                        personalized experiences, a cloud-first strategy, and
                        data-driven decisions arrived at with the help of
                        machine learning & AI.
                        <br /> <br /> For example, in a manufacturing scenario,
                        data from IoT sensors monitoring the performance of
                        machines on the factory floor can be ingested using an
                        edge computing infrastructure. Data analytics is first
                        performed locally; then the data is transferred to a
                        data lake in a cloud environment where advanced
                        analytics, AI and machine learning are applied to larger
                        data sets to gain critical insights. These insights can
                        be used to automatically initiate actions in production
                        & supply chain systems that execute in a traditional
                        infrastructure environment. The hybrid IT components are
                        managed in an integrated fashion to deliver the
                        end-to-end business processes.
                        <br /> <br /> As these examples demonstrate, the
                        potential benefits of hybrid IT are compelling, yet
                        there are notable challenges facing CIOs as they work to
                        embrace or accelerate hybrid cloud.

                      Migration of workloads and integration between the private

                      applications and data do not become fragmented between

                        From being able to migrate between clouds to supporting
                        local data regulations, hybrid cloud enables the
                        advanced level of management of computing resources that
                        is necessary to gain competitive advantage in today’s
                        business climate. However, simple migration isn’t
                        enough. It takes the ability to seamlessly manage and
                        move workloads and jobs between clouds that provides the
                        next level. Some of the entry-level use cases for a
                        hybrid cloud include:

                            allows you to use a non-production workload as a
                            proof-of-concept for your initial entry into a cloud

                        another popular use case, particularly in organizations
                        focused on innovation. Many customers move their
                        dev/test environments to the cloud to gain access to
                        elastic and on-demand IT resources, while leaving their

                        Third, customers move web servers to the cloud to take
                        advantage of the elastic compute resources. This allows
                        a customer to leverage auto-scaling to right-size,
                        compute resources as demand spikes or declines.
                        Organizations can also use the cloud for content
                        delivery, placing their content closer to their
                        end-users to reduce latency. This also adds another
                        layer of business continuity as these, customer-facing
                        applications can be dispersed and stored across multiple

                        There are increasing legal and regulatory requirements
                        for data storage and processing. For example, European
                        data protection laws require protections for personal
                        information that are significantly different from
                        regulations in the United States and other regions. In
                        the United States, medical privacy laws such as HIPAA
                        and others create strict requirements on storage and use
                        of medical data. Utilizing a hybrid cloud is a step in
                        the right direction because you can use public cloud
                        providers in specific regions to support the regulations
                        for processing and storage.{" "}

                        To deliver a good experience, enterprises need to be as
                        close to customers as possible, and they need to
                        understand how customers consume applications, as well
                        as what components (payments, ads, videos) are required
                        from outside sources. Using a hybrid cloud, enterprises
                        can set up multiple availability zones under their
                        control, connect with cloud service providers in
                        regional markets, and use edge computing techniques to

                        The first step is for CIOs to connect with the business
                        to establish clear lines of communication and to set
                        common goals. Within the IT organization, CIOs must set
                        policies that identify the need to prepare for hybrid
                        cloud as a priority for overall IT strategies. Then we
                        recommend assessing the company’s applications and IT
                        estate and creating a roadmap to guide the journey to
                        optimal hybrid cloud. This roadmap should compare
                        current and future run costs to create a business case
                        for change; assess application and workload placement
                        and data locality options; recommend application
                        transformation requirements; consider IT policy and
                        operating model factors; and ultimately produce clear,
                        data-based recommendations with a proposed execution
                        plan to enable hybrid IT transformation to happen.
                        Getting there will require transforming and migrating
                        applications, integrating and orchestrating
                        environments, automating and monitoring business
                        services, enabling digital processes, and integrating
                        data and security.

                          be manually intensive and inefficient. Automation can

                          actions to resolve or even prevent incidents. The idea
