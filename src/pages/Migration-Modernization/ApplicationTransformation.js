                          Inside almost every leading business today there’s a

                          To accommodate the increasing complexity of functional
                          requirements, velocity, volume, and variety that
                          current business demands, IT applications need to
                          embrace a variety of architectural patterns.
                          Organizations must meet ever-changing business demands
                          — from mainframe applications and client-server to
                          service oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices.

                          team, so that you can leverage lot of existing code
                          and reuse your existing codebase. A typical large
                          transformation project can take a year-long effort and
                          often don’t yield results. We recommend taking bottom
                          - up approach, take a small piece of functionality,
                          and develop the services and foundation for it rapidly
                          by using existing application blocks and automation
                          framework. You would minimize your risks by investing
                          a small time & money and continue to do so when you
                          see a significant ROI. The key aspect is time. The
                          advantage of making us your microservices partner is,
                          our open source contribution helps us to deliver
                          values that vary rapidly.
