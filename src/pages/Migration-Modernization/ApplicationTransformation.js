                      To accommodate the increasing complexity of functional
                      requirements, velocity, volume, and variety that current
                      business demands, IT applications need to embrace a

                      ever-changing business demands — from mainframe
                      applications and client-server to service oriented
                      architecture (SOA) and microservices.

                      We go beyond creating a strategy: Synectiks helps you plan
                      it, do it, run it and manage it.
                      <br /> Synectiks reduce the application transformation
                      effort at least by 50% by using open Application blocks
                      (common services for any product), automation blocks and
                      component frameworks built by SYNECTIKS team, so that you
                      can leverage lot of existing code and reuse your existing
                      codebase. A typical large transformation project can take
                      a year-long effort and often don’t yield results. We
                      recommend taking bottom - up approach, take a small piece
                      of functionality, and develop the services and foundation
                      for it rapidly by using existing application blocks and
                      automation framework. You would minimize your risks by
                      investing a small time & money and continue to do so when
                      you see a significant ROI. The key aspect is time. The
                      advantage of making us your microservices partner is, our
                      open source contribution helps us to deliver values that
                      vary rapidly.
