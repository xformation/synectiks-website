								<h3>
									<li>Advertising</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									Advertising allows us to provide, support and improve some of our products.
									Synectiks does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or
									your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other
									data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
									For example:
								</p>
								<p>
									We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Marketo, Google Analytics,
									or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in other sites and apps serviced by
									these partners are more relevant and valuable to you.
								</p>
								<p>
									The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as
									your interests and favorites, your location, or the content you view.
								</p>
								<p>
									The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about
									you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and
									favorites, usage data from our products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of
									our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as “interest-based advertising”
									in this statement.
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									Synectiks will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most
									commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Where Synectiks needs to perform the contract, we are about to enter into or
											have entered into with you;
										</li>
										<li>
											Where it is necessary for Synectiks' legitimate interests (or those of a
											third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those
											interests; and
										</li>
										<li>Where Synectiks needs to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Third-party Services</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by
									clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not
									responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services
									and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Security</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									Synectiks is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety
									of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from
									unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide
									a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
									However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100%
									secure.
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Data Retention</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing
									legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you
									have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
								</p>
								<p>
									When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
									information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for
									example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then
									we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
									processing until deletion is possible.
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Access</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with
									your Account by logging into our Services or emailing <a
										href='mailto:info@synectiks.com'
										rel='nofollow'>
										info@synectiks.com
									</a>. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior to
									deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.
								</p>
								<p>
									To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify
									your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you
									provide us may be archived or stored by us periodically according to backup
									processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery
									purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily
									limited where access and correction could: inhibit Synectiks' ability to comply with
									a legal obligation; inhibit Synectiks' ability to investigate, make or defend legal
									claims result in disclosure of personal information about a third party or result in
									breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business
									information belonging to Synectiks or a third party.
								</p>
								<h3>
									<li>Your Choices</li>
								</h3>
								<p>
									You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby
									limiting the type of information that we collect.
								</p>
								<p>
									You may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us. If you wish
									to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email. Even if you
									unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational, transactional,
									account-related, or similar purposes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your browser
									from accepting new cookies or enable selective use of cookies. Please note that, if
									you choose not to accept cookies, some features and the personalization of our
									Services may no longer work for you. You will continue to receive advertising
									material but it will not be tailored to your interests.
