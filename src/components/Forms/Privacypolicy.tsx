                <h5><li>Site Activity Data</li></h5>
                <p>Each time a visitor comes to this website, our web server collects and logs certain information. These 
                    access logs are kept for a reasonable period of time. These logs include, but are not restricted to, your 
                    machine’s TCP/IP address, your username (if applicable), date, time and files accessed. These logs 
                    are used solely for performance, usability, site administration, security reviews and to help

                <p>
                Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server 
                in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that 
                uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are 
                placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and 
                honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze 
                how our products perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. Our website and applications also 
                contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.
                </p>
                <p>Synectiks uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending

                    <li><b>Security.&nbsp;</b> We use cookies to process information that helps us secure 
                    our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Storing Information.&nbsp;</b>We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide 
                    information to Synectiks, for example when you fill out a contact form on our website, we store the 
                    data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information you’ve filled out, so that 
                    you don’t have to again for future downloads.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Social Media.&nbsp;</b>Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those

                    <li><b>Analytics.&nbsp;</b>We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and 
                    performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or 
                    service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Performance.&nbsp;</b>Synectiks uses cookies to understand and improve how our products and 
                    website perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps

                    </li>
                    <li>Companies that deliver content, such as videos or news, place cookies on their own. These 
                        companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable 
                        these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.

                <p>
                Synectiks website uses technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of 
                our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other 
                identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other 
                products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly 
                identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking the following links:

                <h3><li>Advertising</li></h3>
                <p>
                Advertising allows us to provide, support and improve some of our products. Synectiks does not use what 
                you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to 
                target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party 
                properties. For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Marketo, Google Analytics, or Facebook (see below), so that the 
                ads you see in other sites and apps serviced by these partners are more relevant and valuable to you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and 
                favorites, your location, or the content you view.
                </p>
                <p>
                The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time 
                using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from 
                our products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to 
                these ads as “interest-based advertising” in this statement.
                </p>
                <h3><li>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information</li></h3>
                <p>Synectiks will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will 
                    use your personal information in the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where Synectiks need to perform the contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;</li>
                    <li>Where it is necessary for Synectiks legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and 
                        fundamental rights do not override those interests; and
                    </li>
                    <li>Where Synectiks need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3><li>Third-party Services</li></h3>
                <p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to 
                    those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these 
                    third-party services and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.
                </p>
                <h3><li>Security</li></h3>
                <p>Synectiks is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of 
                    security technologies and measures designed to protect information from 
                    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a 
                    level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please 
                    bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
                </p>
                <h3><li>Data Retention</li></h3>
                <p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate 
                    business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or 
                    to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
                </p>
                <p>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will 
                either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information 
                has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information 
                and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
                </p>
                <h3><li>Access</li></h3>
                <p>If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with 
                    your Account by logging into our Services or emailing <Link to="/contactus">info@synectiks.com</Link>. If you terminate your 
                    Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers 
                    and may remain accessible to the public.

                <p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or

                    disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade 
                    secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to Synectiks or a third party.
