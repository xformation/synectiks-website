          <p>This is overall system architecture. The architecture attempts to ensure scalability across every
            layer (Infrastructure/Application Services) to ensure horizontal scalability everywhere. This is the master
            architecture to write a highly scale-out application, it talks about application services, compute and network platform.

          <ul>
            <li><h4 className="fh4">Section 1</h4></li>
            <p>The upper half deals with the hardware aggregation on the top of cloud layer. With the available
              container orchestrator, we aggregate CPU/Network/Storage and it looks like One big consolidated
              resource. You can deploy application services seamlessly through the Continuous Delivery pipeline, and
              they run being transparent to the underneath computing resources. At application level, the scalability
              is achieved at individual service level as well as elastic resource pool level.
  </p>
            <li><h4 className="fh4">Section 2</h4></li>
            <p>
              The layer no section 2, primarily involves creating resources across Private/Public cloud. In case of
              Hybrid cloud, we prefer opting for our Equinix IBX/IOA implementation so that Private/Public clouds are
              hosted in same private address space. Equinix is doing that.

            <li><h4 className="fh4">Section 3</h4></li>
            <p>
              The bottom half deals with hardware and network scale-out. The architecture assumes hyper
  scaling (<b>Intel RSD Implementation</b>) to seamlessly add CPU/Memory/Storage and create any private cloud on top of it.

            <li><h4 className="fh4">Section 4</h4></li>
            <p>
              At the network layer, it assumes that, private and public cloud are hosted in same colocation ensuring minimal
hop between them as well as they stay in same private network space. We collaborate with Equinix colocation
platform and use their IBX/IOA based communication to guarantee the scalability/performance and security at network layer.

            This is a standard microservice based basic application architecture. We tried to carefully refactor the
            basic services what any enterprise application would require and provision them separately. Each microservice
            uses some combination of Cache/SQL/NoSQL/GRAPH/Bigdata databases to make them individually scalable. The real
            challenges lie in deploying and maintaining so many services along with their databases. We deploy and manage
            all the components of services in aggregated hardware platform so that we can properly address their
lifecycle. <br />Here follows the list of basic services along with their functionality and database components:
</p>
          <ol type="1" className="lineHeight-34" >
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Session &amp; Security Management</b> - Primarily serves session/security/role-based access control. This
              uses REDIS Cluster (cache DB) and NoSQL database (Dynamo).
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Configuration Management</b> - Serves application configuration and config customization abilities. This
              uses Dynamo DB (NoSQL) at the backend.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Workflow Service</b>-- Serves business workflow services. It uses Dynamo DB (NoSQL) at the backend.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Content Service</b>-- Serves storing and accessing and searching of all documents and attachments. It
              uses mongo DB and distributed filesystem (CEPH) at the backend.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Search Service</b> -- Perform elastic and intelligent searches on any record. Uses distributed filesystem for indexing.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>WIKI Service</b> -- It store and manages the text contents. It uses Aurora RDS.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>SSO Service</b> -- It manages the Single-Sign-On service.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Rating / Feedback Service</b> -- - It manages some basic rating/feedback services. It
              uses NEo4j and couch cache database.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Bigdata Analytic Service</b> -- It implements bigdata based analytic services. It uses DRUID
              on top of HDFS for OLAP on bigdata.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>Web UI</b> -- Application Web based UI.
</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;<b>API GATEWAY</b> -- API gateway for API serving.
</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Workflow service use JCR content service, WIKI service to cater horizontal scalability.
</p>
          <p>
            Apart from this, any application will have its own domain driven services depending on its
            functionalities. A highly scale-out application should deploy all its basic services along with its
            domain drive services to an aggregated container cluster. Each individual service uses some combination
            of Cache/SQL/NoSQL/GRAPH/Bigdata database and they also get deployed in aggregated container cluster.
